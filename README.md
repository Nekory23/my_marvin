Jenkins is the most popular Open Source automation platform.

It can automate any task you want, from simple periodic cleanups to full production-scaled deployments.
Therefore, it allows to setup the cornerstone of the DevOps chain: the Continuous Integration / Continuous
Delivery (or Continuous Deployment) pipeline.

You might also have already read or heard about it, going by the name of CI/CD pipeline.

During this project, you are going to master the art of automating your everyday developer tasks with Jenkins.
